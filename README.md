### Linkedin auto apply for jobs bot

This script automatically applies for any available Linkedin jobs.

Some require extra questions in order to apply, such as why do you wanna join their company. These will be skipped since creating an answer for every question would be impossible/a big headache (unless gpt-3?).

Tested on English and Spanish Linkedin, Windows 10.

This bot is currently under development, if you encounter any issues please report them using the Issues tab.
